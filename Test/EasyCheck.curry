--- EasyCheck is a library for automated, specification-based testing of
--- Curry programs. The ideas behind EasyCheck are described in
--- [this paper](http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sebf/pub/flops08.html)
--- The tool `currycheck` automatically executes tests defined with
--- this library. EasyCheck supports the definition of unit tests
--- (also for I/O operations) and property tests parameterized
--- over some arguments. The latter kind of tests can only be executed
--- with KiCS2.
