Curry Libraries
===============

This repository contains the standard libraries of
the Curry distributions PAKCS and KiCS2.

Since there are slight differences in the implementation
of some libraries that are available for both PAKCS and KiCS2,
libraries specific to PAKCS are suffixed by `.pakcs`.
During the make process of PAKCS, these libraries
are copied into the default `lib` directory where the
suffix is removed. The makefiles `Makefiles.*.install`
are responsible for this system-specific installation process.
