Curry Base Libraries
====================

This repository contains the standard libraries of
Curry distributions like
[PAKCS](https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/),
[KiCS2](https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/kics2/), or
[Curry2Go](https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/curry2go/).

The libraries in this package can be used in these Curry systems
without the Curry Package Manager.
Since the structure of this base repository is similar to
other Curry packages, the dependency on a specific version
of the base libraries can be specified in other Curry packages.
